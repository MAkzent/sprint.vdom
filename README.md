# Virtual DOM
### This was created during my time as a [Code Chrysalis](https://codechrysalis.io) Student

This was a paired exercise using TDD to build your own virtual DOM and diffing library similar to those used in most modern frameworks like React and Ember.

Challenge: Recursion, DOM manipulation, Higher Order Functions
